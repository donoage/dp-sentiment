# Cost Optimization Summary

## Problem Identified
The application was consuming excessive network bandwidth and API costs due to:
1. **Wildcard subscriptions** - Subscribing to ALL stocks (`AM.*`, `T.*`) instead of specific tickers
2. **24/7 WebSocket connection** - Connected even when markets are closed (nights, weekends)
3. **Aggressive frontend polling** - Fetching data every 5 seconds
4. **No reconnection backoff** - Fixed 5-second reconnect could cause rapid loops

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Specific Ticker Subscriptions
**Before:**
```javascript
// Subscribed to ALL tickers (thousands of stocks)
params: 'AM.*'  // All minute aggregates
params: 'T.*'   // All trades
```

**After:**
```javascript
// Subscribe only to the ~30 tickers we track
params: 'AM.AAPL,AM.MSFT,AM.NVDA,...'  // Specific tickers only
params: 'T.AAPL,T.MSFT,T.NVDA,...'     // Specific tickers only
```

**Impact:** Reduces incoming data by ~99% (from thousands of tickers to ~30)

### 2. Market Hours Only Connection
**Before:**
- WebSocket connected 24/7 (168 hours/week)
- Receiving data even when markets closed

**After:**
- Only connects during market hours: 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET, Monday-Friday
- Automatically disconnects when market closes
- Checks every minute to reconnect when market opens

**Impact:** Reduces connection time from 168 hours/week to ~32.5 hours/week (~81% reduction)

### 3. Reduced Frontend Polling
**Before:**
```javascript
setInterval(fetchSentiments, 5000);  // Every 5 seconds
```

**After:**
```javascript
setInterval(fetchSentiments, 30000);  // Every 30 seconds
```

**Impact:** Reduces HTTP requests by 83% (from 720/hour to 120/hour)

### 4. Exponential Backoff for Reconnections
**Before:**
- Fixed 5-second reconnect interval
- Could cause rapid reconnection loops

**After:**
- Exponential backoff: 5s â†’ 10s â†’ 20s â†’ 40s â†’ 60s (max)
- Random jitter added to prevent thundering herd
- Only reconnects during market hours

**Impact:** Prevents unnecessary reconnection attempts and API rate limiting

### 5. Enhanced Monitoring
Added detailed logging to track:
- Connection attempts and status
- Message batch statistics (minute bars, trades, darkpool trades)
- Market hours checks
- Reconnection delays

## Expected Cost Savings

### WebSocket Data Usage
- **Before:** ~168 hours/week Ã— thousands of tickers
- **After:** ~32.5 hours/week Ã— 30 tickers
- **Estimated Savings:** 95-99% reduction in WebSocket data

### HTTP API Calls
- **Before:** 720 requests/hour Ã— 24 hours = 17,280 requests/day
- **After:** 120 requests/hour Ã— 24 hours = 2,880 requests/day
- **Estimated Savings:** 83% reduction in HTTP requests

### Overall Network Usage
Combining all optimizations:
- **WebSocket bandwidth:** ~99% reduction
- **Connection time:** ~81% reduction  
- **HTTP requests:** ~83% reduction
- **Total estimated cost reduction:** 85-95%

## Monitoring

To monitor the effectiveness of these changes:

1. Check server logs for connection patterns:
   ```bash
   # Should see "Market is closed" messages outside trading hours
   # Should see specific ticker subscriptions, not wildcards
   ```

2. Watch for batch statistics in logs:
   ```
   ðŸ“Š Batch: 30 minute bars, 150 trades (12 darkpool)
   ```

3. Verify market hours detection:
   ```
   Market opened - connecting WebSocket...
   Market closed - disconnecting WebSocket...
   ```

## Additional Recommendations (Optional)

If further cost reduction is needed:

1. **Reduce ticker count** - Track only top 10 holdings instead of top 20
2. **Increase polling interval** - Change from 30s to 60s or 120s
3. **Add data aggregation** - Batch database updates instead of per-trade
4. **Implement caching** - Cache API responses for 10-30 seconds
5. **Add rate limiting** - Limit max updates per minute per ticker

## Deployment

These changes are backward compatible and require no database migrations.

To deploy:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Optimize network usage to reduce costs"
git push
```

The changes will take effect immediately upon deployment.
