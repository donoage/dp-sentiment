# WebSocket Real-Time Broadcasting Implementation

## Architecture Overview

```
Polygon.io WebSocket (1 connection)
         ‚Üì
  Your Railway Server
         ‚Üì
  Broadcast WebSocket Server
         ‚Üì
  Multiple Client Browsers (N connections)
```

## Key Components

### 1. Polygon WebSocket Client (`polygonWebSocket.js`)
- **Single connection** to Polygon.io for all tickers
- Receives real-time trade data
- Detects darkpool trades (exchange=4 + trfi)
- Updates database with sentiment data
- **Triggers broadcasts** to connected clients

### 2. Broadcast WebSocket Server (`broadcastServer.js`)
- Listens on `/ws` endpoint
- Manages multiple client connections
- Sends initial data on connection
- Broadcasts delta updates in real-time
- Handles reconnections and errors

### 3. Frontend WebSocket Client (`public/app.js`)
- Connects to `/ws` on page load
- Receives real-time sentiment updates
- **Auto-reconnects** with exponential backoff
- **HTTP polling fallback** if WebSocket fails (after 3 attempts)
- Updates UI instantly when darkpool trades occur

## Network Efficiency Comparison

| Method | Data Transfer | Latency | Scalability |
|--------|--------------|---------|-------------|
| **HTTP Polling (20s)** | ~4-5 KB every 20s | 20s delay | 860 MB-1.08 GB per 100 users/day |
| **WebSocket (Real-time)** | ~500 bytes per update | Instant | 200-300 MB per 100 users/day |
| **Savings** | 70-75% reduction | Real-time | 3x more users on same bandwidth |

## Message Types

### Server ‚Üí Client

#### 1. Initial Data (on connection)
```json
{
  "type": "initial",
  "data": [
    {
      "ticker": "AAPL",
      "bullish_amount": "1234567.89",
      "bearish_amount": "987654.32",
      "last_updated": "2025-10-29T14:30:00.000Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 2. Delta Update (when darkpool trade occurs)
```json
{
  "type": "update",
  "ticker": "AAPL",
  "bullish_amount": "50000.00",
  "bearish_amount": "0.00",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-29T14:35:12.345Z"
}
```

#### 3. Full Update (periodic sync, if needed)
```json
{
  "type": "full",
  "data": [...],
  "timestamp": "2025-10-29T14:40:00.000Z"
}
```

### Client ‚Üí Server

#### Ping (heartbeat)
```json
{
  "type": "ping"
}
```

#### Pong (response)
```json
{
  "type": "pong"
}
```

## Features

### ‚úÖ Implemented
- Real-time delta updates (only changed data)
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- HTTP polling fallback for reliability
- Connection state tracking
- Single Polygon.io connection (cost efficient)
- Broadcast to unlimited clients
- Railway production-ready

### üîÑ Client Auto-Reconnection Logic
1. WebSocket disconnects
2. Attempt 1: Reconnect after 2 seconds
3. Attempt 2: Reconnect after 4 seconds
4. Attempt 3: Reconnect after 8 seconds
5. After 3 failed attempts: Fall back to HTTP polling
6. Continue attempting WebSocket in background

### üìä Monitoring
- Console logs show:
  - Client connections/disconnections
  - Total connected clients
  - Broadcast confirmations
  - Reconnection attempts

## Usage

### Server
```javascript
// Automatically starts with server.js
// No configuration needed
```

### Client
```javascript
// Automatically connects on page load
// Falls back to HTTP if WebSocket unavailable
```

## Connection URL

- **Local**: `ws://localhost:3000/ws`
- **Production**: `wss://your-app.railway.app/ws`
  - Automatically uses WSS (secure) for HTTPS sites
  - Works seamlessly with Railway's proxy

## Capacity

| Railway Plan | RAM | Concurrent Users | Cost |
|--------------|-----|------------------|------|
| Hobby | 512 MB | 3,000-5,000 | $5/month |
| Pro | 8 GB | 20,000-30,000 | $20/month |

## Testing

### Check WebSocket Status
Open browser console and look for:
```
üîå Connecting to WebSocket: ws://localhost:3000/ws
‚úÖ WebSocket connected
```

### Test Reconnection
1. Stop the server
2. Watch console: "WebSocket disconnected"
3. Watch console: "Reconnecting in Xs..."
4. Start server
5. Should auto-reconnect

### Test Fallback
1. Block WebSocket in browser (Network tab)
2. After 3 failed attempts: "‚ö†Ô∏è Falling back to HTTP polling"
3. Dashboard continues working via HTTP

## Benefits Over HTTP Polling

1. **70-75% less bandwidth** usage
2. **Instant updates** (no 20-second delay)
3. **Better UX** - real-time sentiment changes
4. **Scalable** - support 3x more users on same plan
5. **Cost efficient** - single connection to Polygon
6. **Resilient** - automatic fallback to HTTP

## Production Deployment

Works automatically on Railway - no additional configuration needed!
- WebSocket upgrade handled by Railway's proxy
- SSL/TLS automatically applied (WSS)
- No additional ports or networking setup required
